			<h1><b>This is the first paragraph example,</b></h1>
			 <b>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.</b> The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

			<h2>This is the second paragraph example,</h2>
			 <u> Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.</u> This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. </p>

			<h3> This the third paragraph example,</h3>
			 Web standards are blueprints –or building blocks– of a consistent and harmonious digitally connected world. <i>They are implemented in browsers, blogs, search engines, and other software that power our experience on the web.</i></P>
